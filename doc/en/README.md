## ☯️ The Philosophy: Hybrid Harmony

Before installing anything, it's important to understand what makes this system special. It's not simply a script, it's a symbiosis between two powerful tools: **Kanata** (for kernel-level precision) and **AutoHotkey** (for contextual intelligence).

To understand how these two forces work together without conflicts, read about our **[Key Concepts](user-guide/concepts.md)**.

## 🚀 Starting the Journey

If this is your first time here, we've prepared a clear path for you:

1.  **Why use this?**: Read the **[Introduction](user-guide/introduction.md)** to understand the advantages over a conventional keyboard.
2.  **Let's get started**: Follow our step-by-step **[Installation Guide](user-guide/installation.md)**. We'll guide you from download to your first ergonomic "Hello World".

## 🎮 Mastering the Tool

Once installed, you have two main superpowers at your disposal:

*   **Leader Mode**: Your command center. Press `CapsLock + Space` to access an infinite contextual menu. Learn to use it in the **[Leader Mode](user-guide/leader-mode.md)** guide.
*   **Homerow Mods**: Modifiers (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) right under your fingers. Forget about stretching your pinky. Master this technique in the **[Homerow Mods](user-guide/homerow-mods.md)** guide.

## 🎨 Your System, Your Rules

HybridCapsLock comes "clean" by design, but it's ready to grow with you.

*   **Need more power?**: Explore our **[Plugin Catalog](../plugins/README.md)**. From Vim integration to Spotify control, you decide what to install.
*   **Are you a developer?**: Create your own layers and workflows. We've prepared a detailed guide on **[How to Create Layers](developer-guide/creating-layers.md)**.
